## Link of the course final setup:
    Prototype website link after configured, made available by the course 
    author. The code available in this repository has some modifications made 
    by me.

## Functionalities:
    
    useContext Hook to avoid prop-drilling;

    useState and useEffect basics;

    useGlobalContext Custom Hook;

    API fetch and await Loading;

    Dynamic fetch, which updates the Cocktails that present the string typed in the 
    input or a error message if the value don't if the value is not the same as the 
    name of any API item;

    react-router-dom usage, with SPA concepts, presence of an invalid url default
     page (Error.js) and dynamic url for each Cocktail using useParams;

    useCallback method to avoid infinite loop render by the useEffect Hook.

    
    
    
## Changes regarding the course design:

    Two new css variables were created, changing the colors of texts,backgrounds, buttons and icons to my enjoy;

    Few changes on CSS attributes values;

    I added my personal logo.
